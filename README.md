# COMP303
Winter 2019, Instructor: Jin Guo
Implementations of different design patterns for pratice. Some are my own or they come from course demo code, GeeksForGeeks, or Derek Banas on YouTube.

With Observer Pattern and Visitor Pattern being the more difficult ones with different styles of implementation, I have included more than one example for each pattern.

The PDF has been useful for lab tests where I needed a quick skim over a pattern's key elements.
TODO: Update LaTeX notes with improved examples and clean up wording.
